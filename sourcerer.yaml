# Define the structure relative to this file's directory.
# For each key:
#  - if the value is a string it is expected to be a git remote bound to "origin"
#  - if the value is a dictionary, the key is a folder
#  - if the value is an array, it should be full of 2-element arrays: ["remote-name", "remote-url"]

# This will result in standard repos in ./sourcerer and ./java/java-util,
# and a repo in ./gollum with two remotes: origin and upstream
sourcerer: "git@github.com:stevearm/sourcerer.git"
java:
  java-util: "git@github.com:stevearm/java-util.git"
gollum:
  - ["origin", "git@github.com:stevearm/gollum.git"]
  - ["upstream", "git@github.com:gollum/gollum.git"]
